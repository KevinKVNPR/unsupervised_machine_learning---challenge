# unsupervised_machine_learning---challenge
You have been handed raw data, so you will first need to process it to fit the machine learning models. Since there is no known classification system, you will need to use unsupervised learning. You will use several clustering algorithms to explore whether the cryptocurrencies can be grouped together with other similar cryptocurrencies. You will use data visualization to share your findings with the investment bank.
